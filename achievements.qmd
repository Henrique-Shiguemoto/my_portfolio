    <h3>CS Bachelor's Degree</h3>
    <p>From 2019 to 2023, I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the State University of Maringá, finishing with a GPA of 3.3. During my studies, I had the chance to attend numerous events related to computer science research, gaining hands-on experience with various technologies, programming languages, and software. Collaborating with an amazing team of professors and peers made me fall in love with the field. My time at university was truly enriching, and I have no regrets about my choice of course.</p><br>
<p>I also want to mention that I participated in two undergraduate research projects on HCI. The first was on Gesture Recognition with Leap Motion and another one on Dashboard Design. Then my bachelor's thesis was also on dashboard design. These studies made me veri interested in Data Analysis, dashboard design and data visualization fields.</p>

    <h3>Kreativstorm DA Program</h3>
    <p>Completed a 2-month international Data Analysis training program with Kreativstorm, collaborating with a diverse team of students and professional data analysts from around the world. Together, we tackled complex case studies, including projects analyzing household behavior in the UK.</p><br>
    <p>Through this experience, I strengthened my theoretical understanding of statistics and data analysis, applied practical skills in R and Python, and developed expertise in hypothesis testing, variable correlation analysis, and case study problem-solving. In addition, working in an international team improved my spoken and written English, enhancing my ability to communicate data insights effectively.</p>

    <h3>EAITI 2022</h3>
    <p>Participated in EAITI (Annual Meeting of Technological Initiation and Innovation) to present my project on Gesture Recognition for Health Information Systems to substitute touch based devices such as mouses and keyboards to combat disease proliferation. The event brought together students from various universities to showcase research from diverse fields including Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, Computer Science, and more, offering a rich exchange of scientific knowledge.</p><br>
    <p>This event not only brought me interest in the field of HCI as a whole, but also to the process of research and development (R&D). Additionally, it gave me a lot of practice with public speaking.</p>
