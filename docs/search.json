    "text": "🎮 Game Development\n\n\n\n\nQuickJelly\n\n\n2D game about controlling a jelly, collecting fruits and avoiding enemies.\n\n\n\nLearned 2D gameplay, physics, audio, rendering, and design.\n\n\nUsed concepts such as Animation Controller, Unity Asset Store, sprite renderers, sorting layers, colliders and much more.\n\n\n\nTech: Unity, C#, Visual Studio\n\n\nGameplay video | More details\n\n\n\n\n\nQuickFlower\n\n\nEngine-less 2D survival game where you control a bee avoiding flowers on a timer.\n\n\n\nImplemented bitmap loading, audio and CPU-side rasterization from scratch with win32 and C.\n\n\nApplied techniques such as SIMD for rendering and QPC for timing with memory usage from syscalls.\n\n\n\nTech: C, Win32 API, Visual Studio\n\n\nGameplay video | More details\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    ×\n    DATASUS Mortality Dashboard\n    I conducted a year-long undergraduate research project focused on developing an innovative solution for visualizing mortality data using publicly available datasets from Brazil’s Universal Health Care System (SUS).\nThe project leveraged R, Shiny, and ggplot2 to build a dashboard prototype. While data acquisition was straightforward thanks to open access, the main challenges lay in data cleaning and manipulation due to complex and case-specific inconsistencies.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    Tableau Data Visualizations\n    After completing a LinkedIn Learning course (see the Achievements tab), I started exploring public datasets from Kaggle and creating interactive dashboards using Tableau. Leveraging Tableau’s features—such as calculated fields, filters, parameters, and dynamic visualizations—I was able to transform raw data into compelling stories. While R and Shiny offer extensive customization, Tableau excels with its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, rapid dashboard development, and built-in visualization types like heat maps, treemaps, and trend lines that make insights more accessible and engaging. \n    \nThrough this hands-on experience, I gained practical knowledge in dashboard design, including prioritizing the most relevant metrics, defining key performance indicators (KPIs), and optimizing visual layouts for clarity and impact.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    HCI-Guided Dashboard Development\n    This project was my Bachelor’s dissertation, where I applied Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) techniques to guide the development of dashboards. The methods applied were from dashboard design, HCI and data visualization authors such as Nielsen, Don Norman, Stephen Few, Scott Berinato, Jonathan Schwabish among others.\nThe work spanned five months applying a 5 step method consisting of literature study, heuristics identification, data visualization tool choice, case study to apply heuristics and pilot testing, resulteding in a prototype built with R, Shiny, and ggplot2. The dashboard was based on publicly available Covid-19 data for the city of Maringá, sourced from Kaggle.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    BipaNota\n    I have over a year of experience developing Android applications with Flutter and Dart, ranging from simple static apps to dynamic, industry-oriented solutions. One of my main projects is BipaNota, a mobile application designed to automate the verification of invoices in stores and distributors. The app includes features such as account authentication, barcode scanning (via both camera and USB scanner), invoice downloads using access keys, and PDF report generation. It also leverages modern development practices like object-oriented programming, RESTful APIs, session authentication, Supabase for database management, custom widgets, and state management with Provider.\nCurrently, BipaNota is in a closed testing phase on Google Play, with active users providing frequent feedback. I work as the sole developer in a team of three, alongside two collaborators focused on marketing and adoption. The application addresses a common challenge in small businesses, where employees spend significant time manually checking deliveries against invoices. By automating this process, BipaNota reduces verification time, freeing up staff to focus on customers. Looking ahead, we plan to expand the project with additional features such as monetization and iOS availability.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    Stelf (Game Store Prototype)\n    This project was a university prototype of a desktop application for a game store, inspired by platforms like Steam. It was developed over the course of three months by a team of four students, following a Scrum-style development cycle with task management handled through Trello. Here’s the repository.\n\nThe application was built using C#, WinForms, and Visual Studio, covering both the front-end interface and the back-end logic. For data storage, we integrated a non-relational MongoDB database to manage the catalog of games available in the store.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    Gesture Recognition for Health IS\n    This was a year-long undergraduate research project focused on developing a gesture recognition system as an alternative to traditional input devices such as keyboards, mice, and touchpads. The goal was to explore new ways of interacting with computers through more natural, touch-free methods.\nFor gesture detection, we used the Leap Motion sensor alongside Java, Selenium, and Eclipse to enable navigation within a Health Information System web application. I documented the entire development process in a research article and had the opportunity to present this work at both EAITI 2022 and CBIS 2022.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    QuickJelly\n    This was my first game project, where the player controls a cute jelly character tasked with collecting fruits scattered across the map while avoiding enemy jellies, all under the pressure of a countdown timer. You can check out a short gameplay video.\nThe game was developed in about a month using C#, Unity, and Visual Studio. Throughout the process, I gained valuable experience in 2D gameplay mechanics, physics, audio integration, rendering, and game design principles, which gave me a strong foundation for future game development projects.\n  \n\n\n  \n    ×\n    QuickFlower\n    This is a 2D game where the player controls a flower trying to escape bees that attempt to pollinate it. The goal is to survive each level for 15 seconds, with increasing difficulty as more bees appear over time. You can watch a short gameplay video.\nThe game was developed using C, the Win32 API, and Visual Studio, without any game engine. Building it from scratch provided hands-on experience in bitmap loading and rendering, audio handling, CPU-side rasterization, SIMD optimizations, and other low-level programming techniques, offering deep insight into the mechanics behind 2D games."
