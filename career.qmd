# Oper - Data Analyst/Engineer

#### ● Mar 2024 - Aug 2025 (1 year and 6 months)

I worked as a Data Analyst and Data Engineer in multidisciplinary teams, analyzing large volumes of data to support data-driven decision-making. I designed and optimized pipelines to improve accessibility and processing efficiency, including enhancing an ETL pipeline in Databricks with SQL and PySpark that achieved a 1500% performance gain.

I developed and maintained dozens of interactive dashboards and reports for national and international clients, contributing to over R\$2.5 million in gross profit and supporting sustainable business growth. I used technologies such as R, Python, SQL, Azure Databricks, PySpark, Excel, and Shiny to create analyses, reports, dashboards, and ETL pipelines.
